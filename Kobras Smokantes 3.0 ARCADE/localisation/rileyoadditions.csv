EVTNAME123412346;Literacy Fix for Austrian Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412346;This event increases the literacy rating for North Italian POPs in Austria to be close to the prevailing historical literacy rate in Northern Italy, such as the independent North Italian minors already start with. As North Italian is not an accepted culture for Austria, POPs of that culture have to otherwise get the generic 10% literacy rate for unaccepted POPs instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412347;Literacy Fix for Hungarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412347;This event increases the literacy rating for Hungarian POPs within the modern-day borders of Hungary from 10% to 25%. 25% is the estimated average literacy in the Austrian Empire for 1836. As Hungarian is not an accepted culture for Austria, POPs of that culture have to otherwise get the generic 10% literacy rate for unaccepted POPs instead. When coupled with the Italian fix, raising Hungarian literacy to a more historical level allows Austria to have the literacy rating promised in the country file, to no longer operate under a handicap they should not have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

This event will give the minorities a literacy rate of 40%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME123412349;Literacy Fix for the Irish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC123412349;This event increases the literacy rating for Irish POPs in the United Kingdom to 30%. As Irish is not accepted by the United Kingdom, the POPs had been receiving the default 10% literacy rate reserved for unaccepted POPs. Real literacy in Ireland was likely at least 30% on average by 1836, and the 10% value severely dragged the in-game literacy rating of the United Kingdom down from the historical 53% or so to 43%. This reduce some of the unwarranted handicap upon the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;
